Simplest definition â€” Function calling function itself.

This is a logical and mathematical concept where we define a function to call itself to return the desired result. A recursive function should always have a termination condition.

If the function does not have a termination condition then the function will not terminate, so the programmer should always be careful while writing a recursive function.
